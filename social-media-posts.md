**Sometimes you need devices but you only have the users, and sometimes you need the users but only have the devices.**

That's the reality of software deployment and administering an enterprise environment.

I built a PowerShell solution that bridges this gap for Intune/Entra ID:
• Query user groups → get their devices (with OS version filtering)
• Query device groups → get their primary users
• Support for nested groups with recursive expansion
• Sync members between groups automatically
• Filter by iOS/Windows versions with 6 comparison operators

Real-world use case: Need to deploy an update to outdated devices? Query your department groups, filter by OS version, and automatically populate your deployment groups.

Sometimes you need devices but only have the users, and sometimes you need the users but only have the devices.

Built a PowerShell script that solves this for Intune/Entra ID - bidirectional user↔device mapping with OS version filtering, nested group support.
